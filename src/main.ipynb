    "There are four sections of the final project. You are expected to perform the following tasks within each section to fulfill the project requirements. \n",
    "1. #### **Data Importing and Pre-processing (25%)**\n",
    "   - Import dataset and describe characteristics such as dimensions, data types, file types, and import methods used\n",
    "   - Clean, wrangle, and handle missing data\n",
    "   - Transform data appropriately using techniques such as aggregation, normalization, and feature construction\n",
    "   - Reduce redundant data and perform need based discretization\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "2. #### **Data Analysis and Visualization (25%)**\n",
    "   - Identify categorical, ordinal, and numerical variables within data\n",
    "   - Provide measures of centrality and distribution with visualizations\n",
    "   - Diagnose for correlations between variables and determine independent and dependent variables\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory analysis in combination with visualization techniques to discover patterns and features of interest\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "1. #### **Data Analytics (25%)**\n",
    "   - Determine the need for a supervised or unsupervised learning method and identify dependent and independent variables\n",
    "   - Train, test, and provide accuracy and evaluation metrics for model results\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### **Presentation (25%)**\n",
    "   - In a 5 to 10 minute presentation, briefly explain the project workflow from the code and results in your markdown notebook\n",
    "   - State your findings from the data and provide the interpretation of results from your analysis at each stage in the project\n",
